Solving problems with Constrained Quadratic Hybrid Solver

Problem setup:

Delivery Truck Packing Problem

Resources:
- 1 truck
- 1 package size
- Up to 100 packages

Things to consider:
- Priority shipping status
- Days since order was placed
- Delivery truck's weight capacity
- Delivery truck's size capacity

CQM Development Process:

1. Write objective and constraints in our problem domain
2. Define binary and/or integer variables for our problem
3. Convert objective and constraints into math statements with binary and/or integer variables
4. Build the CQM model from individual objectives and constraints.

1. Objectives and Constraints:

    Objectives:
    1. Maximize the number of packages selected with priority shipping
    2. Minimize the number of days the packages are in transit

    Constraints:
    1. Do not exceed the maximum number of packages that can fit on the truck(100)
    2. Do not exceed the maximum weight capacity of the truck(300 lbs)

2. Define the variables:

    We need to choose which packages to load onto the delivery truck, so we'll use binary variables

    x_i = 1 if package i is selected
        = 0 if package i is not selected
    
3. Objective and Constraints in math statements

    1. Maximize priority shipping:

    min( -sum(p_i*x_i) from i=0 to i=n)

    p_i = priority of package i
    x_i = decision variable for package i

    2. Minimize wait time:

    min( -sum(d_i*x_i) from i=0 to i=n)

    d_i = number of days since package i was ordered
    x_i = decision variable for package i

    3. Constraint 1 - Select maximum number of packages that can fit inside the truck:

    sum(x_i from i=0 to i=n) = P

    x_i = decision variable for package i
    P = maximum number of packages that can fit on the delivery truck

    Direct implementation of Equality Constraints:

    eq_constraint = (quicksum(x[i] for i in range(num_items)) == max_parcels)

    Constraint 2 - The weight of all packages selected cannot exceed maximu weight of delivery truck

    sum(w_i*x_i from i=0 to i=n) <= W

    w_i = weight of package i 
    x_i = decision variable for package i
    W = Maximum weight for delivery package

    Direct implementation:

    ineq_constraint = (quicksum(weights[i]*x[i] for i in range(num_items)) <= max_weight)

4. Build the CQM

    1. Instantiate a ConstrainedQuadraticModel
    2. Add the objectives to the model
    3. Add the constraints to the model
